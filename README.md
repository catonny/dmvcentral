## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   A Firebase project with Firestore and Authentication enabled.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Firebase:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    *   Add your Firebase project's service account key as a single-line JSON string to the `.env` file:
        ```
        FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT='{ "type": "service_account", "project_id": "...", ... }'
        ```
    *   Update the client-side Firebase configuration in `src/lib/firebase.ts` with your own project's config object.

4.  **Seed the Database:**
    To populate Firestore with initial data (employees, engagement types, etc.), run the seed script.
    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

5.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).
